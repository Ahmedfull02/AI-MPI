# project to implement of supervised machine learning using gradient boosting to solve a classification problem.

### What is Gradient Boosting:
A **Machine leaning** technique where several *weak models* created and combined to create a single, accurate model 

### What is Weak Model:
Weak model or *weak learner* are models that perform a little bit better than **random guessing** (probabilty equal to 0.5). usually those models are created as ***Decision Tress***

### What is the structure of Gradient Boosting:
Multiple weak learners each one sequentially added, correcting its predecessor, the final prediction is made y summing uo the prediction o every weak model within the bigger model.

### Why using this supervised ML:
* It is known to be more accurate and it performe well .
*  Used for multiple tasks like classification and regression...
* It is `interpretable` unlike other ML like neural network...
